```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>

- I added Google fonts and used semantic HTML5
```
```css

- I used query to make it responsive and hover

```

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) - This helped me to use semantic HTML5 correctly.
